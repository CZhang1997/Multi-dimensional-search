 * 		Multi-dimensional search: Consider the web site of a seller like Amazon.  
	They carry tens of thousands of products, and each product has many
	attributes (Name, Size, Description, Keywords, Manufacturer, Price, etc.).  
	The search engine allows users to specify attributes of products that
	they are seeking, and shows products that have most of those
	attributes.  To make search efficient, the data is organized using
	appropriate data structures, such as balanced trees.  But, if products
	are organized by Name, how can search by price implemented efficiently?
	The solution, called indexing in databases, is to create a new set of
	references to the objects for each search field, and organize them to
	implement search operations on that field efficiently.  As the objects
	change, these access structures have to be kept consistent.
